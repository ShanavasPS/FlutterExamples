# Learn flutter with examples

This project is aimed at learning flutter using examples

## Getting Started

Add a new configuration with one of the files listed below as entrypoint if you want to run it.

1. provider.dart - A simple example shows how to use the Provider Consumer state management in flutter
                    This needs the Provider package and make sure it is already added to your project using the command
                    ```flutter pub add provider```
2. multiple_providers.dart - This example shows how to use multiple Providers and how to consume multiple providers.
                            Make sure to install the provider package as in the previous example.
